# Project React Counter

Counter is a simple application to add and substract a number. Just like a sport pedometer.

A complete Counter app should able to:

- See a zero value of the counter when the app starts, along with the <kbd>+</kbd> and <kbd>-</kbd> buttons
- Add one value when the <kbd>+</kbd> button is clicked
- Substract one value when the <kbd>-</kbd> button is clicked
- When value is 0 and <kbd>-</kbd> button is clicked, set alert to give notification that minus number is not allowed.

## Steps

- Create a new repo for the project: `project-react-counter`
- Generate or scaffold the React app using `create-react-app`
- Structure, modify, create, and use the component files
- Push changes to GitHub and submit your project
