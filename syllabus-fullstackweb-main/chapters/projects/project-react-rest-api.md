# Project React REST API

- Create a new repo for the project: `project-react-rest-api`
- Find one or some interesting REST API to experiment with
- Use Postman collection to maintain the REST API requests
  - Export and save the Postman collection (JSON format) to the project
- Generate or scaffold the React app
- Structure, modify, create, and use the component files
  - Feel free to ideate the app by your self, but it has to be an application that has some data within `state` and `props`, not just a regular website
- Use `fetch` or `axios` to request those REST APIs within React app
  - Display the data using DOM
- Push changes to GitHub and submit your project
