# Project React Todos

Todos is a simple application to store and manage our todos, tasks, or activities. Just like Google Keep, Google Tasks, or generic todos app.

A complete Todos app should able to:

- See a blank page if there is no todos
- Show all todos if there is a data
- Save or store todos, tasks, or activities
- Each todo can contains id, text, favorite label, date of creation, tags, etc
- Search or filter todos based on variety of parameters
- Add new todo data
- Remove one specific todo
- Remove all todos
- Update each todo's data

- Feel free to ideate the app by your self, but it has to be an application that has multiple pages, not just one page
- Install `react-router-dom` into the project
- We have to configure the `Router`, `Switch`, `Route` in the root of the app. Then we can navigate between pages using `Link`
- Feel free to ideate the app by your self, but it has to be an application that has some data within `state` and `props`, not just a regular website
- You have to communicate the data between `form` and `input` with `state` and `props`

- Push changes to GitHub and submit your project
