# Project HTML

- Create a new repo for the project: `project-html`
- Create a `README.md` file to describe the project
- Export and put your design images from Figma to the repo
  - Create an `images` folder to contain them
  - Rename the images if you need to, there should be no space (`name name.png`) and no uppercase letters (`Name.png`) to ease the development
- Create HTML file: `index.html`
- Start to implement the design elements gradually to HTML code
- You have to inspect and determine which design elements you're using from the design to the HTML elements or tags
- The main objective is to put the content first
- There's no need to bother about the styling and design accuracy, because later we will use CSS for that
- Remember to use all lowercase characters
- Incrementally push your changes to GitHub
- Submit your project to GitHub Issues
- Finally you can also deploy the project to the web, live using Netlify or GitHub Pages
