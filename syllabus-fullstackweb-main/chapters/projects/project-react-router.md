# Project React Router

- Create a new repo for the project: `project-react-router`
- Generate or scaffold the React app
- Structure, modify, create, and use the component files
- Feel free to ideate the app by your self, but it has to be an application that has multiple pages, not just one page
- Install `react-router-dom` into the project
- We have to configure the `Router`, `Switch`, `Route` in the root of the app. Then we can navigate between pages using `Link`
- Push changes to GitHub and submit your project
