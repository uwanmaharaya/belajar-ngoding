"The minimum viable product is that version of a new product a team uses to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort." - Eric Reis

### Examples of Earliest MVPs

- Instagram: Initially, the MVP was focused on photo filters only. Users could take pictures, apply one of the suggested filters, and save them in an album on their device. Users liked the application and it has since been updated to include videos, geolocation, tagging other users, adding hashtags, and integrating with other social networks.
- Facebook, Snapchat, Spotify, Airbnb, Dropbox, Foursquare, etc

### Principles:

- Build something small, because small things are predictable and inexpensive (cheap) to test.
- Get it into the market quickly, because real learning occurs only when real customers are using a real product.
- Trash it if it's just a hype (flop), or invest if it‚Äôs a seedling with potential.

### Possibilities

Those that create and test a minimum viable product can:

- Save time and resources by making sure they are investing in a project which is likely to be successful
- Check whether the project is appealing to potential users
- Find out which trend will be optimal for full product development, with the help of integrations
- A—Åquire a potential client base and find the product‚Äôs early adopters
- Save time and money in end product development by not needing to conduct expensive market research
- Attract investors earlier

## Simple, Lovable, Complete (SLC)

"The Key to Startup Success? Get Out of the Building" - Steve Blank

The problem is that most customers hate MVPs. Startups are encouraged by the great Reid Hoffman to "launch early enough that you‚Äôre embarrassed by your v1.0 release." But no customer wants to use an unfinished product that the creators are embarrassed by. Customers want great products they can use _now_.

Loveable products are ones that people enjoy using. Viable products may be functional, but not something people enjoy. When we think about a project‚Äôs MVP, we rarely focus on a users wants, but much more on a users needs. Remembering to make a project lovable, helps us refocus, and deliver something the client needs to use, but also in a way that they want to use or interact with it.

## Design Sprint

The sprint is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers. Developed at GV, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúgreatest hits‚Äù of business strategy, innovation, behavior science, design thinking, and more‚Äîpackaged into a battle-tested process that any team can use.

The sprint gives teams a shortcut to learning without building and launching.
