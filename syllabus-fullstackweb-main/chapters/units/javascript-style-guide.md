# JavaScript Style Guide

While programming in JavaScript, most of the time we have to be aware of trivial things such:

- Space vs tabs
- Reserved words
- Case sensitivity
- Semicolon

In order to synchronize the style accross team members, in a team we have to adhere to a single style guide.

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that supports many languages, integrates with most editors, and has few options.

While in development, you can just press save and code is formatted. No need to discuss trivial style again in code review. It will save you time and energy.
