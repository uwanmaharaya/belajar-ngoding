# Project React Redux Complete

- Create a new repo for the project: `project-react-redux-complete`.
- Generate or scaffold a React app.
- Install React dependencies based on our needs:
  - Styling: `reactstrap` or `emotion`
  - Router: `react-router-dom`
  - Request REST API: `axios`
  - Form: `formik` (if just you want to use it)
  - Redux: `redux` and `react-redux`
- Structure, modify, create, and use the components and functions to implement an intergrated React application with a bunch of dependencies.
- Push changes to GitHub, deploy to Netlify, and submit your project
- Create `Todo` Apps
