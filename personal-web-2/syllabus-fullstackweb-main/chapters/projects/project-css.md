# Project CSS

- Create a new repo for the project: `project-css`
- Create a `README.md` file to describe the project
  - If you have a mockup or prototype link, place it as well
- Import the files from your previous `project-html` to the repo, so we don't have to start from scratch
  - Also include the images that repo
- Create HTML file: `index.html`
- Create CSS file: `index.css`
- Start to implement the design styles gradually to HTML and CSS code
- You have to inspect and determine which design elements and what are the -tyles you're using from the design to the HTML and CSS styles
- The main objective is to put the contents first and then style the contents
- Now we need to care about the styling and design accuracy
- Remember to use all lowercase characters
- Incrementally push your changes to GitHub
- Submit your project to GitHub
- Finally you can also deploy the project to the web, live using Netlify
