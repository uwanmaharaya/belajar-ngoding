# Project Personal Website HTML

- Create a new repo for the project: `project-personal-website-html`
- Create a `README.md` file to describe the project
- Export and put your design images from Figma to the repo, then add it into the README
- Create a blank HTML file: `index.html`
- Start to implement the design elements/tags gradually to HTML code
  - Navigation: `<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, etc
  - Header: `<header>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc
  - Content: `<div>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, etc
  - Footer: `<footer>`, etc
- You have to inspect and determine which design elements you're using from the design to the HTML elements/tags
- The main objective is to put the content first before styling the website
- That's why there's no need to bother about the styling and design accuracy, because later we will use CSS for that, not only just HTML
- Remember to use all lowercase characters
- Incrementally push your changes to GitHub
- Submit your project to GitHub Issues
- Finally you can also deploy the project to the web, live using Netlify or GitHub Pages
