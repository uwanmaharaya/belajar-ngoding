# Project Express with MySQL

- Create a new repo for the project: `project-express-mysql`
- Generate or scaffold the Express app either from scratch or using `express-generator`
- Structure, modify, create, and use the modular Node.js files to create a REST API
  - Locally we can also use port `:8000` so it won't conflict with React server
  - In Heroku, the port will be setup automatically via `process.env.PORT`
- We can either:
  - Use a dummy or placeholder data such as `array` of `object` first
  - Use a MySQL connection directly to store and manipulate data
- Check the REST API endpoints using Postman
  - Use Postman collections to better manage your requests
- Push changes to GitHub
- Deploy the app on Heroku
  - Use Config Vars in Heroku to setup the MySQL connection
- Submit your project
