# Project CSS Design System

- Create a new repo for the project: `project-css-design-sytem`
- Create a `README.md` file to describe the project
  - If you have a mockup or prototype link, place it as well
- Either:
  - A) Import the files from your previous `project-html` or `project-css` to the repo, including the images that repo, so we don't have to start from scratch
  - B) Start to build the website from scratch withour previous project files
- Structure, modify, or create the:
  - `index.html` HTML files
  - `index.css` CSS files
  - `assets` or `images` folders
  - `.gitignore` file
- Add one design system of your choice. Such as Bootstrap, Semantic UI, Bulma, Foundation, etc
- It's recommended to use only **one** design system at a time, not using multiple systems at once
- Start to implement the design styles gradually to HTML and CSS code
- You have to inspect and determine which design elements and what are the styles you're using from the design to the HTML and CSS styles
- The main objective is to put the contents first, then style the contents while using a design system
- Incrementally push your changes to GitHub, submit your project to GitHub, then finally deploy the project to the web live using Netlify
