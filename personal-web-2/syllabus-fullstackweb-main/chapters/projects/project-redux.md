# Project Redux

- Create a new repo for the project: `project-redux`
- Generate or scaffold a simple Redux app
- Here we only need one file to contain all the data, logic, and functions:
  - Store
  - Reducers
  - Dispatchers
  - Actions
- Structure, modify, create, and use the functions to implement Redux architecture
- We can also try to request data to a REST API endpoints.
- Push changes to GitHub and submit your project
