In the modern world we live in, there are millions of websites available for free with only capital access to the Internet. Information and news spread across various social sites and media, can be read, heard, and watched easily.

We can exchange information, learn new things, discuss and comment, enjoy entertainment, and more. Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia. These are websites and web examples that are very influential on our lives now. Now everything is accessible via laptop, cellphone, even smartwatch.

Most of these websites are created by developers from scratch or from scratch, others are made with ready-made tools like website builder. The ease of creating a website with tools is of course popular for some people who want to direct its website so, but there are many limitations. We can not control the overall look, some of the cost should be given to the toolmaker, some features are missing or limited, and so on.

Then from that, some people choose to develop their own website or with the help of a team of developers and designers. This takes time and process, of course, but it will be invaluable for our personal development and experience. With the will and ability to create a website that is basically coding, we like having super power that can maximize this digital technology.
