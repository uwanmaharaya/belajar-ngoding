## 5 Levels Of Student Engagement: A Continuum For Teaching

### 1. Authentic Engagement

Students are immersed in work that has clear meaning and immediate value to them (reading a book on a topic of personal interest).

Characterized by: persistence, sustained inquiry, self-direction, playfulness with content, and unprompted transfer of understanding

### 2. Ritual Compliance

The work has little or no immediate meaning to students, but there are extrinsic outcomes of value that keep them engaged (earning grades necessary for college acceptance).

Characterized by: clear effort; some creativity; focus on directions and task completion in order to meet extrinsic standards for motivation

### 3. Passive Compliance

Students see little or no meaning in the assigned work but expend effort merely to avoid negative consequences (not having to stay in during recess to complete work).

Characterized by: minimal effort made only to mitigate ‘consequences’ or other negative ‘punishers’; no creativity, genius, curiosity, or transfer

### 4. Retreatism

Students are disengaged from assigned work and make no attempt to comply but are not disruptive to the learning of others.

Characterized by: little to no effort, productivity, or progress; no demonstrated inquiry, affection, or interest in the content, collaborations, or task

### 5. Rebellion

Students refuse to do the assigned task, act disruptive, and attempt to substitute alternative activities.

Characterized by: zero demonstration of learning; outright disruption & defiance
